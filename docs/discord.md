# Discord

Do you want to talk about your findings in the TeslaBLE API, get help, or just want to discuss your projects somewhere? Well you can on the official Discord server. Feel free to talk to others or even ping the reverser or me if you want to (the server admin). I will be making announcements there too about new Tesla apps, new VCSEC updates, documentation changes, and possibly more.
